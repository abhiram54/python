COVID-19 Simulation:
The objective of this project is to develop a COVID-19 simulation application that can be used to model the spread of the virus in each population, simulate the impact of different interventions, and provide insights into how the pandemic may evolve between states. Design and develop the back-end components of the application using Python programming language and Django web framework. Develop the simulation engine using Pythonâ€™sscientific libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to model the spread of the virus in a population
